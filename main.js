They are designed to print out two cards per 8.5&quot;x11&quot; paper.\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nIncludes:\r\n- 18 unique Bingo playing cards\r\n- Calling Cards\r\n- 132 markers\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nDIRECTIONS:\r\nPrint out as many game boards as you need (18 unique boards included – keep in mind if you print duplicates, you may have multiple winners)   \r\nPunch out markers with a 1” hole punch\r\nCut out calling cards, shuffle, and begin calling!\r\nFirst person to have 4 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, WINS!\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n**********PLEASE NOTE ********* \r\nAt a party, it is best to have more than one &quot;prize.&quot; While the cards are all unique, it is possible to have simultaneous &quot;BINGO&quot; winners due to the order in which cards are drawn, the fact that there is a &quot;free space&quot;, and the fact that there are more character cards than 24 spaces, so different cards have different character combinations. ***\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n It is recommended that  you use cardstock to print on, and set your printer to a “premium paper” setting to achieve the best results.   I test all of my digital printables on my HP OfficeJet inkjet 6500 printer.  Keep in mind that color and print quality may vary based on your equipment.  You should be sure to have the latest version of Adobe Reader (available free online).\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n*** I do not own the images and you are not paying for the images.  You are paying me for my time and skill in creating these digital files.  This item is not to be resold.***",

            "description": "Beautiful Vintage Cribbage Board made by Chas Goodall & Son Ltd. London. Charles Goodall founded his company in Soho in 1820 and became famous for producing high quality playing cards. His two sons joined him in the business and in 1860 they introduced accessories for playing cards such as cribbage boards and whist markers.  \r\n\r\nThe board is mahogany ground with rosewood and satinwood veneers.  Nicely polished there is a chevron pattern down the centre and inlaid cribbage tracks.  There is a pegslide cover underneath containing the original bone pegs; two red and two white.  The label on the back is marked &#39;The Cribbage Board - No.9914 - Chas.Goodall &Son, Ltd.   The board rests on four brass button feet.\r\n\r\nThis rare piece is in excellent condition; there are a couple of light scratches to the base, slight wear on the brass feet and the red pegs have lost some colour - but given its age it looks virtually new!\r\n\r\nApproximate Measurements:-\r\n\r\nLength 10 inches (  ) x Width 3 1/4 x Depth 3/4 inches .\r\n\r\nA fantastic addition to any collection of vintage games and accessories\r\n\r\nSee my other Vintage Collectables at :-\r\n\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/crabtulip?section_id=14478540&ref=shopsection_leftnav_3",
